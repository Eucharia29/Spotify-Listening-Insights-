### **Steps Taken in Power BI**
1. **Data Import**:  
   The dataset was imported into Power BI and cleaned to ensure consistency. The fields included track name, artist name, ms_played, platform, shuffle mode, and reason for ending the track.  

2. **Transformations**:  
   - Created a new column to group playback times into time periods: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night.  
   - Converted playback time from milliseconds to hours for better readability.  

3. **Visualizations**:  
   - **Card Visuals**: Displayed total playback time, average playback time, and total tracks played.  
   - **Bar Charts**: Showed most played tracks, skipped tracks, and platform usage.  
   - **Pie Charts**: Displayed skip rates and reasons for ending tracks.  
   - **Line Graph**: Highlighted listening trends over time.  

4. **Key Calculations**:  
     *Calculated Columns and Measures:*  
   - Converted `ms_played` into hours for readability:  
     ```DAX
     Playback Hours = SUM('Data'[ms_played]) / 3600000
     ```  
   - Average playback time:  
     ```DAX
     Avg Track Time = AVERAGE('Data'[ms_played]) / 60000
     ```  
   - Total days in the dataset:  
     ```DAX
     Total Days = DATEDIFF(MIN('Data'[ts]), MAX('Data'[ts]), DAY)
     ```
